# Country Look-Up
This is a React app that allows users to look up a country from a list of countries generated by getting data from an API. Once the search has been narrowed down to one country, the page is automatically populated with information about it such as its capital, flag, and even its capital's current weather (generated from a second API). This page has not been styled...yet!
